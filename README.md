## Introduction

This repository contains the OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification for the OpenAI API. It provides a comprehensive description of the available endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication methods for interacting with OpenAI's powerful language models and tools.

### OpenAI Services Covered

- **Chat Completions**: Generate human-like text responses based on prompts.
- **Audio Transcription and Translation**: Convert audio files into text or translate them into different languages.
- **Image Generation and Editing**: Create or modify images using text prompts.
- **Embeddings**: Convert text into numerical vectors for machine learning models.
- **Fine-tuning**: Customize pre-trained models for specific tasks.
- **File Management**: Upload, manage, and retrieve files used for training and other purposes.
- **Moderation**: Check text for content that violates OpenAI's usage policies.
- **Assistants API (beta)**: Create AI assistants to help with various tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **An OpenAI API key**: Sign up at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) to get your API key.
2. **Basic understanding of RESTful APIs and JSON**:
   - **RESTful APIs**: A style of web service that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources. Learn more at [RESTful API Introduction](https://restfulapi.net/).
   - **JSON**: A lightweight data-interchange format. Learn more at [JSON Introduction](https://www.json.org/).
3. **A text editor or IDE**: Such as Visual Studio Code (VSCode), Sublime Text, or Atom.
4. **(Optional) Postman, curl, or any API testing tool**:
   - **Postman**: An API platform for building and using APIs. Learn more at [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
   - **curl**: A command-line tool for transferring data with URLs. Learn more at [curl](https://curl.se/).
   - **API testing tools**: Tools like Insomnia, Paw, or RESTClient.

## Installation

This repository contains an OpenAPI specification file, which doesn't require installation in the traditional sense. However, to make the most of it, you may want to set up some tools:

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi.git
   ```
2. **Install Swagger UI (optional, for visual exploration)**:

   - **Swagger UI**: A tool to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources. Learn more at [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/).
   - **npm**: A package manager for JavaScript. Learn more at [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   npm install swagger-ui-dist
   ```
3. **Install an OpenAPI generator (optional, for client library generation)**:

   - **OpenAPI Generator**: A tool to generate API client libraries, server stubs, documentation, and configuration. Learn more at [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

   ```bash
   npm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli -g
   ```

## Usage

### Viewing the Specification

1. **Open the `openapi.yaml` file** in your text editor to explore the API structure.

   - **YAML file**: A human-friendly data serialization standard. Learn more at [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
   - **Text editor**: Such as VSCode, Sublime Text, or Atom.
2. **To view the specification in Swagger UI**:

   - Copy the `swagger-ui-dist` folder to your project directory
   - Create an `index.html` file with the following content:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="utf-8" />
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
       <title>OpenAI API Specification</title>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="swagger-ui-dist/swagger-ui.css" />
     </head>
     <body>
       <div id="swagger-ui"></div>
       <script src="swagger-ui-dist/swagger-ui-bundle.js"></script>
       <script>
         window.onload = () => {
           window.ui = SwaggerUIBundle({
             url: "openapi.yaml",
             dom_id: "#swagger-ui",
           });
         };
       </script>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
   - Run `http-server` in your project directory
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Generating Client Libraries

To generate client libraries for your preferred programming language:

```bash
openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g <language> -o ./client
```

Replace `<language>` with your desired language (e.g., `python`, `javascript`, `java`).

## API Endpoints

The specification covers the following main categories of endpoints:

- `/chat/completions`
- `/audio/transcriptions`
- `/audio/translations`
- `/images/generations`
- `/embeddings`
- `/fine-tuning/jobs`
- `/files`
- `/moderations`
- `/assistants` (beta)
- `/threads` (beta)

### Examples

#### Chat Completions

Generate a response to a user message:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
  }'
```

#### Audio Transcriptions

Transcribe an audio file:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F file=@path/to/audio/file \
  -F model="whisper-1"
```

#### Image Generation

Generate an image based on a text prompt:

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "A cute baby sea otter",
    "n": 1,
    "size": "1024x1024"
  }'
```

## Authentication

All requests to the OpenAI API require authentication. You need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Python Script Example

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}
data = {
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json())
```

### curl Example

```bash
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
  }'
```

### Step-by-Step Guide to Run the Script

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. Download it from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Install Requests Library**: Run `pip install requests` in your terminal.
3. **Create a Python File**: Create a file named `openai_example.py` and paste the Python script above.
4. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the script, and run `python openai_example.py`.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
Check that you're using the correct endpoint URLs and request structures.
Verify that your requests include the required headers and parameters.
Consult the OpenAI documentation for specific error messages and their meanings.
